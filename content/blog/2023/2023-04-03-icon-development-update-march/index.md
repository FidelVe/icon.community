In March, the team has activated BTP blocks on the Berlin testnet. BTP contracts have been deployed on ICON Berlin testnet, BSC testnet and ETH Sepolia.  In this article, we share tasks completed and development milestones for April.

## BTP Architecture/ Product

It has been a busy month of March, with the team making great progress. BTP blocks have been activated on the Berlin testnet! BTP contracts have been deployed on ICON Berlin testnet, BSC testnet, and ETH Sepolia.

Now, it's time for our team to continue testing, identifying improvements, fixing bugs, and improving the relay and BMV components.

This is also the perfect time for other teams to explore how they can adopt BTP's xcall to enable new functionality on their applications. They can help identify any missing tools or documentation that would assist in onboarding teams to adopt the technology.

More information on the testnet incentivisation plans will follow shortly.

- Splitting the source code into several repos
    - Java - Done
    - Solidity - Done
    - Relayer-common - Done

### Challenges

It is worth noting again that as we get to the stage of deploying BTP to its respective testnets, we expect to face minor issues due to the general nature of testnets. This is nothing major however its a valid risk to take into account as we move forward.
