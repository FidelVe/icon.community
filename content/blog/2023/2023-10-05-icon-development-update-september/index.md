September unfolded as a landmark month in xCall's journey, with BTP blocks having been meticulously tested and deployed to mainnet. This development being not only a fundamental piece of the puzzle for xCall itself but also paving the way for the IBC Archway integration to be successfully deployed to mainnet within the month. Additionally, we have been able to celebrate the xCall Incentivized Testnet Challenge winners and present an updated integration milestones board with the community this month.

## xCall Architecture / Product

Development this month has centered around the activation and testing of BTP blocks (on which other integration milestones for this month were dependent) through testnet and on to final deployment on mainnet. An additional goal for the team has been to improve the onboarding experience for new developers, with this month seeing them providing additional support for those undertaking the Incentivized Testnet and focussing on tooling to enable easy adoption of xCall.

### Last Month

- Support provided for the Incentivized Testnet.
- BTP blocks activated and tested on Lisbon.
- [Public keys registered](https://docs.icon.community/getting-started/how-to-run-a-validator-node/register-prep-node-public-key) for validators.
- BTP blocks activated on mainnet.


### Next Month

- Build out client library for xCall SDK.
- Work on revisions for xCall SDK.
- Commence testing on xCall SDK.
- Development has commenced on a BTP tracker, dependent on the xCall SDK - specifications. This is still being worked on.
- Planning has started to deploy BTP to mainnet.

## xCall Integrations

In September, pivotal steps were taken in xCall’s development journey, with particular importance placed on the activation of BTP blocks on ICON mainnet. This was a necessary step to allow further progress toward the team major priorities for September;

- Getting the Archway integration to mainnet
- Planning out all the xCall integrations we have in the pipeline next (make sure you read last months update, which discusses future plans)

Further IBC development, along with essential fixes for Archway and Neutron, were successfully deployed on Lisbon and underwent a thorough retesting phase to ascertain stability and efficacy. At the end of the month, the IBC Archway integration was successfully deployed to respective mainnets. Concurrently, strategic planning has begun to ascertain the next set of interoperable protocols to be integrated with xCall, underlining our commitment to continuous development and enhancement in the interoperability domain.

Now that progress can be made in parallel across a variety of integrations, we have updated the [integrations milestone board](https://iconfoundation.notion.site/Integrations-66221606c1464911be07c4ae73813578) to make things easier for the community to follow along with.
For more detailed information on the monthly progress of our IBC integrations, we invite you to explore our latest report [here](https://github.com/icon-project/grants-program/blob/main/progress-reports/ibc-integration/iBriz-IBC-August-2023-Progress-Update.md).

### Accomplished in September:
- Work completed on all the issues identified via internal audits.
- IBC integrations deployed with fixes for Archway and Neutron on Lisbon.
- Everything retested on Lisbon.
- IBC archway integration deployed to mainnet.
- Planning commenced for the next set of interoperable protocols for xCall to be integrated with.

### Upcoming in October:
- Solidity conversion of xCall v2 contract.
- Deploy xCall v2 on Berlin, eth and BSC testnets for testing.
- Work on xCall adaptors for Wormhole and Layerzero.
- Deploy Neutron integration to mainnet.
