September was a significant month for xCall, as BTP blocks were thoroughly tested and deployed to the mainnet. This development is not only crucial for xCall, but it also sets the stage for the successful deployment of IBC Archway integration to the mainnet by the end of the month. Moreover, we were able to announce the winners of the xCall Incentivized Testnet Challenge and share an updated integration milestones board with the community.

## xCall Architecture / Product

Development this month has focused on activating and testing BTP blocks, which other integration milestones for this month depended on. This involved testing them on the testnet and deploying them on the mainnet. Additionally, the team aimed to enhance the onboarding experience for new developers, such as providing additional support for those participating in the Incentivized Testnet and prioritizing the development of tooling to facilitate the adoption of xCall.

### Last Month

- Support provided for the Incentivized Testnet.
- BTP blocks activated and tested on Lisbon.
- [Public keys registered](https://docs.icon.community/getting-started/how-to-run-a-validator-node/register-prep-node-public-key) for validators.
- BTP blocks activated on mainnet.


### Next Month

- Build out client library for xCall SDK.
- Work on revisions for xCall SDK.
- Commence testing on xCall SDK.
- Development has commenced on a BTP tracker, dependent on the xCall SDK - specifications. This is still being worked on.
- Planning has started to deploy BTP to mainnet.

## xCall Integrations

In September, pivotal steps were taken in xCall’s development journey, with particular importance placed on the activation of BTP blocks on ICON mainnet. This was a necessary step to allow further progress toward the team’s major priorities for September:

- Getting the Archway integration to mainnet
- Planning out all the xCall integrations we have in the pipeline next (make sure you read last months update, which discusses future plans)

The development of IBC, along with necessary fixes for Archway and Neutron, has been successfully deployed on Lisbon and has undergone a comprehensive retesting phase to ensure stability and effectiveness. By the end of the month, the integration of IBC Archway was successfully deployed to the respective mainnets. At the same time, strategic planning has commenced to determine the next set of interoperable protocols to be integrated with xCall, demonstrating our dedication to continuous development and improvement in the field of interoperability.

Now that progress can be made simultaneously across various integrations, we have updated the [integrations milestone board](https://www.notion.so/66221606c1464911be07c4ae73813578?pvs=21) to make it easier for the community to follow along. For more detailed information on the monthly progress of our IBC integrations, we invite you to explore our latest report [here](https://github.com/icon-project/grants-program/blob/main/progress-reports/ibc-integration/iBriz-IBC-August-2023-Progress-Update.md).

### Accomplished in September:
- Work completed on all the issues identified via internal audits.
- IBC integrations deployed with fixes for Archway and Neutron on Lisbon.
- Everything retested on Lisbon.
- IBC archway integration deployed to mainnet.
- Planning commenced for the next set of interoperable protocols for xCall to be integrated with.

### Upcoming in October:
- Solidity conversion of xCall v2 contract.
- Deploy xCall v2 on Berlin, eth and BSC testnets for testing.
- Work on xCall adaptors for Wormhole and Layerzero.
- Deploy Neutron integration to mainnet.

A Milestone board for ongoing integration efforts can be found [here](https://www.notion.so/66221606c1464911be07c4ae73813578?pvs=21).
