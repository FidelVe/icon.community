What an exciting couple of weeks it has been for xCall with the Incentivized Testnet Program! During this first phase of the program, our goal was to target both high-value submissions that could contribute something important to the early stages of the xCall ecosystem and projects that have potential for further development. That's exactly what we found. We received 18 high-quality submissions, making them eligible for a total of 331,700 ICX in rewards.

Many of these projects showcase infrastructure products that, if fully developed, would provide a solid foundation for a simplified and robust developer experience for teams building with xCall.
