# ICON Foundation to Discontinue ICE and SNOW Funding 

While we appreciate the ICE and SNOW teams’ efforts to bring EVM compatibility to the ICON ecosystem, the ICON Foundation has decided to no longer provide funding beyond the teams’ currently contracted terms, due to a recent turnover of key members that makes it difficult for the Foundation to properly assess the near term future plans for the project.

The teams, whose contracts expire at the ends of March and April, have been notified of this decision. 

## Where do we go from here? 

Acknowledging that this impacts many in the ICON community, we will work with the ICE and SNOW teams to provide more information regarding their plans for next steps once ICON discontinues funding. 

The Foundation will share more information with the community as it becomes available.
