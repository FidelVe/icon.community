This is a step-by-step guide on how to submit a solution for a challenge in the Incentivized xCall Testnet Program.

Submitting a solution via the [challenge submission form](https://forms.gle/FFWQDgQfKKSMXCSw7) is the only way to be eligible to receive a reward. Rewards can be as high as 40k ICX, and there is a total of 845k ICX (about $200k USD) available to be distributed to challenge winners.

The first step is to complete your work, including code demos, articles written, or bug reports filed. **After completing your work**, please submit your solution via the challenge submission form.

### Step 1: Go to the [challenge submission form](https://forms.gle/FFWQDgQfKKSMXCSw7)

### Step 3: Provide a way for us to find your work and contact you

It is very important to provide accurate and complete contact information so that we can provide rewards or ask follow-up questions if necessary. If your submission does not involve on-chain contracts, please write "n/a" for that question.
