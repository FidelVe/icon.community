xCall is the one messaging standard for all cross-chain communication.

Compatible with all existing and future cross-chain protocols, xCall completes the modular blockchain stack by providing dApps with a customizable interoperability component.

It enables developers to build cross chain dApps with a single interface, regardless of which interoperability protocol is chosen. xCall standardizes cross chain communication for developers so that once a dApp is configured to receive messages from one xCall-connected chain, it can receive messages from any xCall-connected chain. This opens developers to a world of cross chain possibilities from the comfort of their preferred chains and wallets.
