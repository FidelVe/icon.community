During the month of June, our dedicated team provided ample support for our focus testers as they began experimenting with BTP and xCall. This immersive process yielded a wealth of valuable feedback and insightful tips, which we have eagerly absorbed and begun addressing. The areas of improvement span across documentation, environment setup, bug detection, and several other key aspects that are detailed comprehensively in this [announcement](https://icon.community/blog/2023/xcall-focus-testing-recap/) 

As we move forward into this month, we are ready to deploy numerous fixes and optimizations meticulously crafted for all contracts. Our main goal is to achieve optimal functionality and a smooth user experience in anticipation of the upcoming Testnet Incentivization Program.

## xCall Architecture / Product

This past month, we successfully conducted end-to-end testing on ICON and BSC testnets and initiated the BSC Plato upgrade, among other tasks. Focus testing was also completed, leading to bug identification and fixes. As we proceed into the next month, our priority will be implementing these fixes and continuing work on trustless bridging between the BSC testnet and ICON, due mid-July. We're also set to upgrade our Solidity contracts, launch our testnet incentivisation program, and deploy updates to Havah BTP integration.

## xCall Integrations

The integration of IBC with ICON to Archway is progressing smoothly and efficiently. We're delighted to announce that integration testing has been successfully completed, and our dedicated team is currently in the midst of conducting end-to-end testing. As of now, all testing operations are confined to local instances. However, we anticipate soon expanding these operations to include the deployment on Berlin and Archway testnets, with more comprehensive testing to follow.

We are tirelessly working towards an official testnet deployment scheduled for the 14th of August, 2023. Audit processes are expected to commence shortly after this milestone. Please note, our timeline is subject to change, and if any alterations arise, we will keep our community updated. 

Milestone boards for both IBC and BTP integrations are published here:

- [IBC Integrations Milestones](https://www.notion.so/66221606c1464911be07c4ae73813578?pvs=21).
