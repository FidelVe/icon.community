## xCall Architecture / Product

The xCall teams have been focused on ongoing testing and debugging of the BSC and ETH relay and BMV components. They successfully enabled trustless bridging between ETH Sepolia and ICON and updated the relay and BMV to align with the BSC testnet's Luban update. They began focus testing with ecosystem builders, aiming to identify bugs and implement necessary fixes. The team also started planning for the BSC Plato upgrade and the testnet incentivization program.

## xCall Integrations

The integration of xCall into IBC is making great progress. We are pleased to announce that all the IBC core contracts for both ICON and Archway have been successfully developed. Additionally, the relay component has been completed as well. Our team has been diligently conducting integration tests between these contracts and relays. Once this crucial step is finalized and any identified issues have been resolved, we will proceed with comprehensive end-to-end testing.

For more detailed information on the monthly progress of our IBC integrations, we invite you to explore our latest report available at the following link:
